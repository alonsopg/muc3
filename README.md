This is the text corpus created by the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](http://www.nist.gov/) for the third [Message Understanding Conference (MUC-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Understanding_Conference) in 1991, and reused for MUC-4 in 1992. It contains news reports covering terrorist activities in Latin America.

The authoritative source of this data is the [NIST MUC project](http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/related_projects/muc/). It can be downloaded as a compressed tar file from the [MUC Data Sets](http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/related_projects/muc/muc_data/muc_data_index.html) link on the project page. The data comes as four large plain text files, which have been split up and reformatted here so that each news item is in a separate HTML file.
