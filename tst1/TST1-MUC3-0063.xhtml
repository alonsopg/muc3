BY DOING THIS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ARREST AT ANY TIME THE FOLLOWERS OF GENERAL NORIEGA, CURRENTLY UNDER ARREST IN FLORIDA ON DRUG TRAFFICKING CHARGES.</p><p>A CITIZEN BY THE NAME OF CUETO, WHO IS FRIGHTENED BY THE CRIME IN VERACRUZ, SAID THAT "ONE OF THESE DRUG DEALERS DISTRIBUTED A LEAFLET ON THE NIGHT OF 11 MARCH THAT WARNED THE POPULATION THAT ANYONE WHO REPORTS THE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-NORIEGA BAND, LIVING IN VERACRUZ, TO THE AUTHORITIES WILL DIE IMMEDIATELY WITH THEIR TONGUES HANGING LIKE A TIE. THE LEAFLET ADDS THAT IN A FEW DAYS THE BAND WILL PLACE BOMBS NEAR HOWARD AIR FORCE BASE TO AVENGE THE ARREST OF THEIR CRONIES IN THE CURUNDU NEIGHBORHOOD."</p><p>FINALLY, EL SIGLO HAS LEARNED THAT THE CRIMINALS AND DRUG DEALERS WHO HAVE INVADED VERACRUZ HAVE SMALL CANOES AND SMALL MOTOR BOATS WITH WHICH THEY TRAVEL TO THE CAPITAL POSING AS FISHERMEN. IN THESE SMALL BOATS, THEY TRANSPORT THE DRUGS THAT THEY WILL SELL DURING THE WEEK IN PANAMA CITY; THIS DRUGS ARE STORED IN DIFFERENT HOUSES IN VERACRUZ.</p><p>IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MOST OF THESE CRIMINALS BELONG TO THE CODEPADI [COMMITTEE FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE FATHERLAND AND DIGNITY] AND THE DIGNITY BATTALIONS, AND AS FAR AS WE COULD DETERMINE, THEY ARE STILL RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE WHO THRIVED DURING THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT AND WHO ARE CONTINUING TO STRUGGLE FOR NORIEGA'S RETURN.</p></body></html>
