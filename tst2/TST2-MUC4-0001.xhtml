AID TO EL SALVADOR HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. ATTENTION: THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT HAS SUSPENDED ITS AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.</p><p>SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTER LUIS YANEZ [AS HEARD] REPORTED TODAY THAT SPAIN HAS SUSPENDED AID TO THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE KILLINGS OF THE SPANISH JESUITS, WHO HAD BEEN LIVING IN OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS, ARE RESOLVED.</p><p>THIS REPORT REPRESENTS A SERIOUS POLITICAL SETBACK FOR THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT. THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT'S DECISION FURTHER ISOLATES THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE BECAUSE OF CALLS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SUSPENSION OF MILITARY AID. THIS SUSPENSION REPRESENTS A HALT IN THE DELIVERY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT TO SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT.</p><p>THIS REPRESENTS INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION. THE INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION OF THE CRISTIANI REGIME IS GROWING.</p></body></html>
