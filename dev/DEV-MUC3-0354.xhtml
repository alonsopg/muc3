ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE UNANIMOUSLY REJECTED THE MURDER OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN. THE WAVE OF POLITICAL MURDERS HAS LEFT THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF SHOCK. FOLLOWING ARE SOME REACTIONS VOICED TODAY AT THE WAKE FOR THE MURDERED LIBERAL CANDIDATE:</p><p>[BEGIN RECORDING] [CONSERVATIVE PARTY LEADER ALVARO GOMEZ HURTADO] THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN ATTACKED FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS AND IT HAS NOT ACCEPTED THIS FACT. I HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR A STATE OF SIEGE TO BE IMPLEMENTED. AT LAST, THE STATE OF SIEGE WAS DECLARED YESTERDAY. I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR THIS FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. GALAN WOULD NOT BE DEAD TODAY IF THE PROPOSAL WE MADE 3 YEARS AGO WOULD HAD BEEN ACCEPTED.</p><p>[FORMER LIBERAL COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT ALFONSO LOPEZ MICHELSEN] IT WAS RIGHT TO CALL FOR A REACTION FROM THE COUNTRY; WE HAVE TO LEARN TO REACT, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO DO SO.
