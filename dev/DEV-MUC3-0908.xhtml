WHEN THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED THAT ORTEGA HAD SUPPLIED ARMS TO THE FMLN, WHICH WERE SECRETLY INTENDED FOR THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF THE SANDINIST ARMY -- AS WAS THE CASE OF THE SAM-7 MISSILES -- THEY ORDERED HIM TO STOP SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORISTS BECAUSE THIS IS ENDANGERING USSR AND U.S. RAPPROCHEMENT POLICIES. THE KREMLIN HAS REACTED WITH NOTICEABLE ANNOYANCE FOLLOWING FIDEL CASTRO AND DANIEL ORTEGA'S DIRECT MEDDLING, WHICH IS CAUSING SERIOUS DIVISIONS WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SANDINIST GOVERNMENT BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMANDERS DID NOT AGREE ON SUPPORTING THE FMLN TERRORIST UPSURGE.</p><p>THE EXPULSION ORDER FOR JORGE SHAFIK HANDAL, JOAQUIN VILLALOBOS, AND OTHER FMLN LEADERS IS EXPECTED ANY MOMENT NOW. THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE FMLN'S POLITICAL CLOUT. AT THE SUMMIT MEETING BETWEEN THE SOVIET AND U.S. PRESIDENTS, CASTRO AND ORTEGA'S AGGRESSION, USING THE FMLN AGAINST THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, WILL BE REVIEWED FOLLOWING PRESIDENT ARIAS OF COSTA RICA'S INITIATIVE.</p></body></html>
