THE ARCE BATTALION CHIEFS SAID THAT CLASHES TOOK PLACE IN THE AREA OF PERQUIN AND ADMITTED THAT TWO SOLDIERS WERE KILLED IN THE CLASHES.</p><p>IN REGARD TO THOSE STATEMENTS, WE CONSIDER THAT:</p><p>1. FOR 7 YEARS AND AFTER HAVING BEEN EXPELLED FROM THAT AREA, THE GOVERNMENT FORCES DO NOT HAVE FIXED POSITIONS NORTH OF MORAZAN DEPARTMENT. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF OUR TRUCE, ARCE BATTALION TROOPS HAVE BEGUN TO ENTER OUR TERRITORIES. THUS, THE CASUALTIES SUSTAINED BY THE ARCE BATTALION ARE A RESULT OF ACTIONS IN WHICH THE FMLN ACTED IN DEFENSE OF ITS FORCES.</p><p>2. ALL ENEMY UNITS THAT CROSS THE TOROLA RIVER DURING AN OPERATION [WORD INDISTINCT] BECOME A MILITARY TARGET AND MORE SO IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE THE ARMED FORCES BOMBED AND STRAFFED PERQUIN CIVILIANS, AMONG WHOM THERE HAVE BEEN CASUALTIES.</p><p>3. WE REITERATE OUR POSITION OF MAINTAINING THE TRUCE DURING THE ESTABLISHED DAYS JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN DOING, ALTHOUGH UP UNTIL NOW THE REGIME HAS FAILED TO EXPRESS ANY GOODWILL; HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE EVACUATION OF THE WAR DISABLED; AND HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BOMBINGS AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION.</p></body></html>
