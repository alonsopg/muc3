ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS REPORT, THE CRIMINALS ARE WELL-ARMED AND APPARENTLY, WILLING TO FIGHT TO THE END TO MAINTAIN THE CRIMINAL RING, LEFT TO THEM BY FORMER DICTATOR MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA.</p><p>"THEY HAVE WEAPONS SIMILAR TO THE ONES USED BY THE MURDERING DIGNITY BATTALIONS' IN THEIR PRACTICES AND THEY HAVE RECEIVED MANY LATE NIGHT VISITS; SOME NEIGHBORS SAY THEY ALSO SELL DRUGS," SAID A VERACRUZ RESIDENT WHO DID NOT WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED FOR FEAR OF RETALIATION BY THE COLOMBIAN CRIMINALS.</p><p>THE CHARGES PRESENTED BY VERACRUZ RESIDENTS MAY RESULT IN ANOTHER POLICE OPERATION THAT WILL, ONCE AND FOR ALL, ELIMINATE ALL THE BANDS OF ARMED ASSAILANTS AND DRUG TRAFFICKERS WHO WERE ARMED IN THE PAST BY MANUEL ANTONIO NOREIGA DICTATORSHIP. THE MOST DANGEROUS ASPECT OF THIS SITUATION IS THE RUMORS IN THE CORREGIMIENTO THAT MANY COLOMBIANS, WHO ESCAPED FROM THE RECENT POLICE OPERATION IN CURUNDU, HAVE HIDDEN IN VERACRUZ AND THIS CLEARLY INDICATES THAT THERE IS A FEARLESS ARMY OF CRIMINALS MADE UP OF PANAMANIANS AND UNDOCUMENTED COLOMBIANS.
