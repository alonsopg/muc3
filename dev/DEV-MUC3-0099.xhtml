HE SAID THAT THE ATTACK IS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLOWS THAT POLICE HAVE DEALT TO DRUG TRAFFICKERS, INCLUDING THE ARREST OF SEVERAL DRUG GANG LEADERS IN UCHIZA, A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE ATTACK. HE ADDED THAT IN ORDER TO STRUGGLE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, PERU NEEDS MORE TECHNOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL AID, ESPECIALLY FROM THE UNITED STATES, THE WORLD'S LARGEST DRUG CONSUMER.</p></body></html>
