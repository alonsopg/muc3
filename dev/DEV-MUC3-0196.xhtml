HERE IS SHAFIK HANDAL, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF EL SALVADOR:</p><p>[BEGIN RECORDING] [HANDAL] IN EL SALVADOR AND THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WORKERS AND PEOPLES PREPARING TO CELEBRATE MAY DAY, INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY. IN EL SALVADOR, MAY DAY WILL BE A GREAT JOURNEY OF STRUGGLES AGAINST REPRESSION, WHICH HAS INCREASED AFTER THE NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE TRIUMPH AT THE 19 MARCH ELECTIONS. THE JOURNEY WILL ALSO BE ONE OF RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND BETTER ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS FOR THE WORKING CLASS LIVING IN A SITUATION OF TOTAL POVERTY AND MISERY. IT WILL BE A JOURNEY OF STRUGGLE FOR A NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT. IT WILL BE A GREAT EFFORT TO CREATE A GREAT AND BROAD NATIONAL MOVEMENT IN WHICH THE MOST VARIED POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND RELIGIOUS FORCES WOULD CONVERGE TO BEGIN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS -- BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY ON ONE SIDE, AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT ON THE OTHER -- TO REACH AGREEMENTS THAT WILL BRING A JUST PEACE AND WILL THUS OPEN UP A STAGE OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT, DEMOCRACY, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.
