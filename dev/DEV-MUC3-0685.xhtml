IF THEY SEE ANY SUSPICIOUS-LOOKING PEOPLE OR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY, THEY ARE ASKED TO PLEASE ADVISE THE NEAREST MILITARY GARRISON OR DIAL 123. THEY ARE ALSO URGED TO REFRAIN FROM TRAVELING IN THE STREETS, BECAUSE THE TERRORIST CRIMINALS ARE USING PICK-UP TRUCKS TO HARASS PERSONNEL AT SOME ROADBLOCKS. THIS COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO GO HOME OR ANYWHERE ELSE.</p><p>THEREFORE, PLEASE AVOID TRAVELLING IN THE STREETS. REMAIN WHEREVER YOU ARE, WHETHER IN AN OFFICE, A RESTAURANT, A WORKSHOP, OR AT HOME. PLEASE REMAIN WHEREVER YOU ARE.</p></body></html>
