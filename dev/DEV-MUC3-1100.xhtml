IN VIEW OF THESE ACTIONS, THE FMLN STATES:</p><p>1. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY ATTACK, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT PURPOSEFULLY BECAUSE THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE AS AN AREA POPULATED BY REPATRIATES.</p><p>2. THIS NEW CRIME DESTROYS THE VAUNTED FALSE IMAGE OF PROFESSIONALISM BY THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND SHOWS THAT THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A DAILY PRACTICE IN THE ARMY.</p><p>3. THIS ACTION ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE AIR FORCE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION [TO THE CONFLICT]. THE PERSISTENCE OF THESE CRIMES AGAINST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE CONFIRMS THE NEED FOR US TO REMAIN ARMED AND TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.</p><p>WE CALL ON ALL HUMANITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE ACTIONS AND TO DENOUNCE THEM WITH FULL VIGOR.</p></body></html>
