BISHOP PABLO SMITH AND FRANCISCA COLOMER MISQUITA WERE SERIOUSLY WOUNDED. THIS IS PART OF THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WHICH INVADED PANAMA AND CONDUCTED A MILITARY INCURSION INTO THE HOME OF THE NICARAGUAN AMBASSADOR IN THAT COUNTRY.</p><p>THE NICARAGUAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS THESE SERIOUS INCIDENTS, WHICH ENDANGER THE PEACE EFFORTS CONDUCTED BY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND SUPPORTED BY THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE. NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA SAAVEDRA CALLS ON THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND ON THE COUNTRY'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FORCES TO CONDEMN THIS BRUTAL CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST RELIGIOUS PEOPLE. THIS ACTION IS SIMILAR TO THE ASSASSINATION OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS PERPETRATED IN SAN SALVADOR ON 16 NOVEMBER 1989 BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH JUST AS THE COUNTERREVOLUTION AND THE OTHER RIGHTIST NICARAGUAN FORCES, DEFENDS THE AGGRESSIVE POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES.</p><p>MANAGUA, 2 JANUARY 1990.</p></body></html>
