THE PLAN WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN 3 MONTHS AT THE LATEST, ACCORDING TO INFORMATION PUBLISHED TODAY ON THE ALREADY FAMOUS GOVERNMENT-MAFIA DIALOGUE BY LA PRENSA.</p><p>THE OPPOSITION NEWSPAPER LA PRENSA, OF BOGOTA, YESTERDAY PUBLISHED A REPORT ACCORDING TO WHICH SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PRESIDENCY GERMAN MONTOYA, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT, HELD PEACE TALKS FOR A YEAR WITH SPOKESMEN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS. THE OFFICIAL HAS DENIED THIS REPORT AND DESCRIBED IT AS "HARMFUL AND SLANDEROUS."</p><p>ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS, THE CARTEL BOSSES PRESENTED THE PLAN TO THE PRESIDENCY IN SEPTEMBER 1988 AND THE PRESIDENCY SHOULD HAVE WORKED ON IT "DIRECTLY AND SECRETLY."</p><p>THE PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD THREE PHASES, WAS FORMULATED AFTER THE MAFIA BOSSES HAD DECIDED TO ACCEPT PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO'S PEACE PLAN (WHICH WAS PROPOSED TO THE COUNTRY ON 1 SEPTEMBER 1988) "WITHOUT HESITATION."</p><p>ACCORDING TO THE CARTEL PLAN, IN ADDITION TO GRANTING THE PARDON, THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO LIFT THE STATE OF SIEGE REGULATIONS TO FIGHT TERRORISM AND DRUG TRAFFICKING AND TO SECURE FROM THE UNITED STATES A JUDICIAL PARDON FOR COLOMBIANS WANTED BY U.S. FEDERAL COURTS. THIS LAST ASPECT WAS THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS "BECAUSE THE COLOMBIAN OFFICIALS DID NOT FIND A WAY TO DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH THE U.S. ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HAS DECIDED TO FIGHT THE PROBLEM MILITARILY," ACCORDING TO FORMER MINISTER JOAQUIN VALLEJO, WHO ACTED AS A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS IN THE TALKS WITH THE GOVERNMENT. ACCORDING TO VALLEJO, A TRIPARTITE DIALOGUE BETWEEN COLOMBIA AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES (COCAINE CONSUMERS) ON THE NONEXTRADITION OF COLOMBIANS WAS AN ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENT FOR MONTOYA TO GO AHEAD WITH THE PACIFICATION CONTACTS.</p><p>THE FORMER MINISTER SAID: "THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT DECLARED WAR ON DRUG TRAFFICKERS BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD TAKEN THIS MEASURE FIRST." HE ADDED: "AFTER THE NUMEROUS MURDERS OF THE RECENT MONTHS, THE PRESIDENT THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP TALKING (WITH THE DRUG BOSSES)."</p><p>IN ACTIONS THAT OBSERVERS DESCRIBED AS "INEXPLICABLE," ASSASSINS PAID BY THE COCAINE CARTELS KILLED FIVE COLOMBIAN PERSONALITIES, INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LUIS CARLOS GALAN, BETWEEN 27 JUNE AND 18 AUGUST.</p><p>MEANWHILE, THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT VIRGILIO BARCO TODAY CONTINUED TO BE SEVERELY CRITICIZED AND ACCUSED OF HANDLING THE ANTIDRUG STRUGGLE WITH A "DOUBLE STANDARD" AND CONCEALING "MANY TRUTHS" RELATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.</p><p>ALVARO LEYVA, PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL OF THE OPPOSITION SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE PARTY WHO SECURED THE DOCUMENTS THAT LA PRENSA PUBLISHED, POINTED OUT: "I WANT THE FULL TRUTH TO BE DISCLOSED BECAUSE THE FATE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE IS AT STAKE."</p><p>LEYVA FINALLY SAID: "I WANT TO KNOW ALL. IT IS A SAD THING DEAD MEN CANNOT SPEAK, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ALWAYS THOUGHT THE GOVERNMENT MEANT BUSINESS, AND WHO THOUGHT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY AUTHORITIES DO WHAT THEY SAY THEY WILL."</p></body></html>
